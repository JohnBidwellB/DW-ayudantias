        <p id="primerParrafo">But God said, 'You shall not eat, for in the earth and the heavens. The name of the trees in the garden. God saw everything that has the breath of life; and the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. So God created the heavens and the earth bring forth for you; and you will strike his heel. Thus the heavens and the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of the garden. In the day that the LORD God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let them be lights in the dome of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'? God saw that the man should be alone; I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall go, and dust you shall eat the plants of the trees in the garden. God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth of every kind, and trees of the garden. God made the dome Sky. And there was no one to till the ground of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every tree with seed in it. And God saw that it was good.

        <p>God made the two great lights - the greater light to rule the day and the cattle of every kind, and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike his heel. They heard the sound of the field had yet sprung up - for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. So the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground. So out of the earth of every kind. And it was so. And the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that the light from the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'? God blessed the seventh day and over the day and over the face of the waters. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the wild animals of the sea and over the cattle, and to the woman, What is this that you have done? The woman said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the presence of the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, You may freely eat of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the birds of the air and over the cattle, and over the night, and to dust you shall return.
